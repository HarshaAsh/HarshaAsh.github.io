## Achyuthuni Sri Harsha

#### Who am I

I am currently working as a data science consultant at Deloitte. I work with various business clients in supply chain and manufacturing domains to solve business problems using data and statistics. I am also pursuing MSc in Business Analytics (part-time) from Imperial College London. 

I am an alumnus of the [Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore](https://www.iimb.ac.in/home) in [Business Analytics and Intelligence](https://www.iimb.ac.in/eep/product/259/Business-Analytics-Intelligence-BAI?management=BusinessAnalytics&addurl=BAI&Ref=IIMBsite). BAI is an executive on-campus one-year program with a focus on statistics, business and technology. &#8216;Building R&R contests for one of India&#8217;s largest life insurance company&#8217; which is our team&#8217;s capstone project got the &#8216;Highly commended project&#8217; award.

Previously I worked as a senior business analyst at Tesco [Tesco Bengaluru](http://www.tescobengaluru.com/) and prior to that at [Mu-Sigma](https://www.mu-sigma.com/). 

#### Why this blog

Sometimes, unless I do something, I don&#8217;t completely understand it. After learning something new, especially in the space of data science, I try to solve a simple problem using what I just learned. This blog is a cumulation of all my notes from such learnings. 

#### What else

I try to use problems and issues from my everyday life and try to solve them using statistical/data science lens. I have been attempting to publish some of these everyday problems which can be solved using data science as papers and conference articles, some of which are:

  1. Personal analytics: Time management using Google maps (presented in ICSADADS-2020)
  2. Personal analytics: Selection of a phone using AHP

Other publications include:
