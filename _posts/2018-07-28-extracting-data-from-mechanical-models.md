  Recently I came across problems trying to automate simple engineering routines, and the first step in a large number of these problems is extracting data from already existing models for further analysis.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The list of posts below is about a problem where data from CAD/CAM models should be extracted to excel for further processing. I am using Visual Basic for writing and executing code while Siemens NX 10.0 journaling for CAD.
</p>

Our current problem has three parts posted as separate blogs.

  1. [Open an NX model and select a part](https://www.harshaash.com/selecting-a-part-in-nx-journalling/)
  2. [Get all dimensions of the part](https://www.harshaash.com/getting-the-dimensions-of-the-selected-part/)
  3. [Export the dimensions to excel](https://www.harshaash.com/exporting-dimensions-to-excel-from-nx/)
